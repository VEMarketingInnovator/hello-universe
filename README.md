Hello Universe,

I would like you to know I am taking digital marketing to the next level With Githib.


I am a fearless marketing professional with a passion for innovation. 
You know, the person with the "is she cray?",pith decks and unorthadoxed
marketing strategies... YEP! THAT'S ME!

I do the research, develop strategy, activate and deploy! 

Why do the same thing if it's not working?
Why wait for someone else to blaze the trail?
Why say "I wish I would have thought of that" for the hundredth time?
